## Information
Everything used in some way with the palera1n jailbreak can be found in this organization.



### Translations
Our loader app supports localizations while palera1n CLI does not; if you feel that you want to translate the loader in another language, you may do so at https://crowdin.palera.in (preferred).

- If you see any incorrect translations, you may fix them.
- We will review translations before making the push to the app; when they are pushed, they will appear in the next iteration of palera1n.
