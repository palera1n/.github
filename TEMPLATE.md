###  But what is palera1n?
palera1n is a developer-oriented jailbreak for checkm8 devices (A8-A11) on iOS 15.0-16.5, when you jailbreak correctly an app on your homescreen will appear and will allow you to install the essentials needed for using the jailbreak, such as [Sileo](https://github.com/Sileo/Sileo) and [Zebra](https://github.com/zbrateam/Zebra).

This is supposed to be use on your computer to jailbreak your iOS or iPadOS device, a jailbreak FAQ and be found on iOS CFW Guide [here](https://ios.cfw.guide/faq/). More questions on palera1n can be redirected to our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/palera1n).

### Translations
Our loader app supports localizations while palera1n CLI does not; if you feel that you want to translate the loader in another language, you may do so at https://crowdin.palera.in (preferred).

- If you see any incorrect translations, you may fix them.
- We will review translations before making the push to the app; when they are pushed, they will appear in the next iteration of palera1n.
